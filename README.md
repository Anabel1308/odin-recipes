My first webpage

This is my first project of a website. I am going to put in practice all my knowledge about HTML and CSS.

I have modificated my CSS code in order to change the appearance of my website:
-Background image of the web
-Font family
-Style links (text-decoration, anchor:pseudo-class)
-Style lists (line-weight, list-style-image, list-style-position)
