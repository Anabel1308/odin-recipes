        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Cream shortening, peanut butter, and both sugars in a large bowl with an electric mixer until light and fluffy. Beat in egg until incorporated. Mix flour, baking soda, baking powder, and salt in a separate bowl; gradually stir into peanut butter mixture until combined. Cover and refrigerate dough for at least 1 hour.</li>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
                <li>Roll chilled dough into walnut-sized balls and place 2 inches apart onto baking sheets. Flatten dough balls with a fork dipped in flour to form a crosswise pattern.</li>
                <li>Bake in the preheated oven until edges are set, 10 to 12 minutes. Transfer cookies to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
